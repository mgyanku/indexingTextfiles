Ingredients
120g butter, softened
75g light brown sugar
75g golden caster sugar
1 medium egg
1 tsp vanilla extract
180g plain flour
1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
150g dark chocolate, cut into chunks
Method
Step 1 Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line two baking sheets with
parchment. Cream the butter and sugars together until very light and fluffy,
then beat in the egg and vanilla. Once combined, stir in the flour, bicarb,
chocolate and ¼ tsp salt.
Step 2 Scoop 10 large tbsps of the mixture onto the trays, leaving enough space
between each to allow for spreading. Bake for 10-12 mins or until firm at
the edges but still soft in the middle – they will harden a little as they cool.
Leave to cool on the tray for a few mins before eating warm, or transfer to a
wire rack to cool completely. Will keep for three days in an airtight container.
